<h3 align="center">Senior C++ Game Developer 🎮</h3>


- ⚒️ I am a seasoned developer with over 10 years of development experience and currently working in the mobile games industry, crafting games with a focus on mobile devices.

<!-- - 🗒️ Occasionally, in my free time I share my insights and experiences through articles on my personal blog, exploring various aspects of game development and design -[https://efreyu.github.io/](https://efreyu.github.io/)-->

- 🏓 My true passion lies in **game development** and **game design**. There's something magical about turning ideas into interactive experiences that captivate players and leave them with unforgettable memories.

- 🚀 My favorite language for bringing these visions to life is **C++**. Its versatility and efficiency empower me to build performant and robust gaming experiences. Additionally, I use scripting languages such as **Lua** for game logic and **Python** for automation.

Let's connect and collaborate to create something incredible together! <!-- Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for exciting opportunities or just to geek out about games.-->
