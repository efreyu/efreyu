<h1 align="left">Hi there 👋, I'm Artur</h1>
<h3 align="left">Senior C++ Game Developer 🎮</h3>


- ⚒️ I am a seasoned developer with over 10 years of development experience and currently working in the mobile games industry, crafting games with a focus on mobile devices.

<!-- - 🗒️ Occasionally, in my free time I share my insights and experiences through articles on my personal blog, exploring various aspects of game development and design -[https://efreyu.github.io/](https://efreyu.github.io/)-->

- 🏓 My true passion lies in **game development** and **game design**. There's something magical about turning ideas into interactive experiences that captivate players and leave them with unforgettable memories.

- 🚀 My favorite language for bringing these visions to life is **C++**. Its versatility and efficiency empower me to build performant and robust gaming experiences. Additionally, I use scripting languages such as **Lua** for game logic and **Python** for automation.

Let's connect and collaborate to create something incredible together! Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for exciting opportunities or just to geek out about games.
